# Platform-owned WOPI architecture

Office contains a Nuxt/Vue wrapper and a pinned Collabora CODE deployment.
Verentis.Collaboration alone owns sessions, document-scoped credentials,
discovery/proof verification, locks, mutation receipts and persistence.
Node remains the authoritative file store. There is no Office database,
client secret, signing key, WOPI host or platform-file backend.

## Admission and consent

A verified signed application declares `capabilities: [wopi]`, exact wrapper
and operator origins, supported formats/actions and bounded session/file limits.
Workspace administrators review document-processing consent for that candidate.
Installation establishes revocable editor trust, not blanket document access.
Every launch and operation still checks current user/document authorization.
First- and third-party editors use the same contract; no Office-name exception
or per-editor OAuth-client registration is used.

Ordinary applications that call platform APIs retain their existing OAuth
authentication and backend delegation. A WOPI declaration or package signature
is not a replacement credential for those APIs.

## Browser boundaries

The platform parent obtains a single-use embed ticket before navigating the
wrapper. Server-authorized CSP restricts ancestors to that exact workspace.
The SDK pins the parent window/origin and correlates requests with the host
session. The parent chooses launch identity from its current installation and
file context; the child cannot substitute it.

Only scoped WOPI launch data reaches the wrapper. It validates the action,
CODE/platform origins, stable source path, current document context and absolute
expiry, then form-POSTs the token to CODE. The CODE proxy obtains platform framing
authorization before admitting wrapper and workspace ancestors. It never handles
WOPI callbacks. Credentials are not persisted in browser storage.

## Save and recovery

CODE messages have a separate exact child-window/origin boundary. Modification
messages latch dirty state in both wrapper and host; route/unload guards preserve
unverified edits. Explicit saves receive platform checkpoints and pass their
correlation to CODE. Only a matching durable platform receipt with no later edits
clears dirty state. Expiry, revocation, conflicts and unavailable status never
silently acknowledge a save. Reopening goes through fresh platform admission.

See [browser/API contract](api.md) and [verification](verification.md). Real warm
Collabora open/edit/save/reopen/coauthor/revoke evidence is mandatory; isolated
unit tests and mock framing responses are not that evidence.
